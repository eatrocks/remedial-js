Context
Context (or function context) is a reference to the
object that “owns” the currently executing code.

The context is is passed to the function
as an implicit parameter named "this".

Scope is function based, context is object based.

What "this" refers to depends upon how the function is invoked
1. as a method on an object - see this-method.js
2.
1. as a Function - called with ()
//       but not the other ways (method, constructor, apply/call)
